# TIGERs Mannheim Open-Source Mechanics

This repository contains mechanics for our robots and our base station. There is one folder for each released version.  
Mechanics are designed with [Autodesk Inventor Professional 2019](https://www.autodesk.com/education/free-software/inventor-professional)  (v2020) and [Autodesk Inventor Professional 2022](https://www.autodesk.com/education/free-software/inventor-professional) (v2022) which is available for free for students.

Have a look at our [2020 ETDP](https://tigers-mannheim.de/download/tdps/2020_ETDP_TIGERS.pdf) and [2020 Champion Paper](https://download.tigers-mannheim.de/papers/2021-RoboCup-Champion.pdf) which contain many details about design decisions and lessons learned over the last 10 years.

Please check subfolders for further information on each version.
